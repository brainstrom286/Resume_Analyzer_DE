AI Resume Analyzer is a frontend-based web application that analyzes a resume
and provides a **resume score** along with **actionable improvement suggestions**.
The project is designed as an **AI prototype**, focusing on logic, UI, and extensibility.

## 📌 Project Overview

Many students struggle to understand whether their resume is strong enough for
placements or internships. This project helps users get quick feedback on their
resume quality before applying.

The application evaluates resumes using **rule-based logic** that simulates
AI decision-making and is structured so that real **ML/NLP models** can be
integrated in the future.
